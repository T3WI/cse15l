Lab 4
=====

Keys Pressed:
```ssh cs15lsp23nm@ieng6.ucsd.edu<enter>```

Because I am doing this on a fresh shell, commands were not available from previous attempts.

Keys Pressed:
```cd -- -cs<tab><enter>ls<enter>```
![Image](2.png)<br>
The directory holding my lab stuff is in -cs15l-lab-reports, which can be gotten too more quickly with ```<tab>```.

Keys Pressed:
```cd lab4<enter>ls<enter>```
![Image](3.png)<br>
Just changing directories to the one where I want to clone it.

Keys Pressed:
```<ctrl>v<enter>ls<enter>```
![Image](4.png)<br>
Because the  git clone command was already on my clipboard, I was able to paste it into the terminal. Then I used ls to check it was there.

Keys Pressed:
```cd lab7<enter>ls<enter>```

Just entering the directory

Keys Pressed:
```bash test.sh<Enter>```
![Image](6.png)<br>
Running bash test script.

Keys Pressed:
```vim ListExamples.java```
![Image](7.png)<br>
Opens the java file in vim.

Keys Pressed:
```<Shift>g6kexi2<Esc>```
![Image](8.png)<br>
```Shift + G``` brings the cursor to the bottom of the document. ```6k``` moves the cursor up 6 lines. ```e``` moves the cursor to the next word, which is index1 inthis case. ```x``` deletes the character it is over, which is the number 1 in this case. ```i``` puts vim in insertion mode. ```2``` add the number 2 where the cursor is. ```<Esc>``` Brings vim back into command mode.

Keys Pressed:
```:wq<Enter>```
![Image](9.png)<br>
Saves and quits the file.

Keys Pressed:
```<up><up><Enter>```
![Image](10.png)<br>
Because the bash script was done earlier, I can just press up twice to get to it again. And we can see the tests succeed.

Keys Pressed:
```git add*<Enter>git commit -m "message"<Enter>git push```
![Image](11.png)<br>
I set up ssh, but it still won't let me push.
