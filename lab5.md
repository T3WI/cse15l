## Debugging Scenario
**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**
Windows


**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**
It doesn't work :(. The program is supposed to print the sum of the arguments called by java onto a text file. Output from the java file is being put into the txt file, but the output isn't what I was expecting. Whenever I input 3 numbers, the output is 3-digit number that is composed of the input numbers in the order of it being inputted in the java command. We should expect it to output 6, 15, and 6.

**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**
